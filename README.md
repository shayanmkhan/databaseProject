# Database Management Project
The main purpose of this project was the following:
1. Design a relational database for an imaginary company
2. Implement the database in SQL using Oracle Database
3. Populate the database with reasonably realistic data
4. Perform a series of advanced queries on the database in order to extract insights from the data in various ways

The primary functions of the implementation are separated into SQL scripts, each of which can be run on any Oracle Database system to reproduce our results. A report containing the output of all queries can be found in the "Report.pdf" file.
